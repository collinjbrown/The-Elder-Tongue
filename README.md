# The Moonlight Tongue
 A Metroidvania game about....

 Check out [Pixapper](https://github.com/collinjbrown/Pixapper), a little program I made for this game that takes in two pngs and maps one to the other for easy implementation into *The Moonlight Tongue*'s rendering system.
 
# To Do ~ Short Term:
- Figure out if I can alter my continuous collision algorithm to account for object rotation.
- Reimplement tiling to work with our new texture mapping system (there seems to be an issue here, but I still need to figure out what exactly is broken).
- Add scenes / global state.
- Maybe write a scene editor.

# To Do ~ Long Term:
## Rendering
- ~~Render sprites.~~
- ~~Play animations.~~
- ~~Add particle effects.~~
- Lighting
## UI & Input
- ~~Add basic input.~~
- Add buttons.
- Add menus.
- Make inputs mappable.
- Saving and loading.
## Physics
- ~~Add gravity, accelaration, velocity, etc.~~
- ~~Add colliders.~~
## Audio
- Add music / sound effects.
## Gameplay
- ~~Add movement.~~
- ~~Add some basic combat.~~
- Who knows?

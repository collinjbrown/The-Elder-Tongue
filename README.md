# The Moonlight Tongue
 A Metroidvania game about....

 Check out [Pixapper](https://github.com/collinjbrown/Pixapper), a little program I made for this game that takes in two pngs and maps one to the other for easy implementation into *The Moonlight Tongue*'s rendering system.
 
# To Do ~ Short Term:
- Part of me wants to kinda go for a slash-em-up style, *Metal Gear Revengance*-esque combat system, but that might conflict with the narrative I have kicking around in my head right now.
- I'd also like to consider the type of health system we're gonna use. I assumed everything was a one-hit KO, but it might be interesting to have a little more depth.
- Reimplement tiling to work with our new texture mapping system (there seems to be an issue here, but I still need to figure out what exactly is broken).
- Add scenes / global state.
- Maybe write a scene editor.
